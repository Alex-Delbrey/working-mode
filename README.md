## This is a mini project that has two main goals. 

1. Learn the Go language
- Unfortunately this project is too simple and will not contain concepts like concurrency which is the main portion of learning Go.

2. Create a little app that when ran, sets a timer for me to focus on my current work. Yes, this is just a timer

## Big Thanks

[This](https://rtbell.dev/blog/golang/learn-golang-with-me) guide helped me out to get the overall structure done and to learn about Go. 

## TODO
- Customize to only work for hours
- Replace rest with a question to continue or not (would restart timer)
- add GUI, maybe like a decreasing time bar
- Create a make file so that I can build the project with `make work` and run the project with `work`
